            <p></p>Stanisław Szukalski (13 December 1893 – 19 May 1987) was a Polish-born American sculptor and painter
            who
            became a part of the Chicago Renaissance. In 1930s Poland he enjoyed fame as a nationalist sculptor.
            <p>Between Poland and Chicago
                Szukalski was born in Warta, Poland, and was raised in Gidle, a nearby village. He arrived at New York
                with
                his mother, Konstancja, and sister, Alfreda, on June 27, 1907; they then went to Chicago to join his
                father, Dyonizy Szukalski, a blacksmith. A child prodigy in sculpture, he enrolled at age 13 at the Art
                Institute of Chicago. A year later, Sculptor Antoni Popiel persuaded Szukalski’s parents to send him
                back
                to Poland, to enroll at Kraków’s Academy of Fine Arts in 1910. There he studied sculpture under
                Konstanty
                Laszczka for three years. He returned to Chicago in 1913.</p>

            <p>Back in the U.S., Szukalski joined the arts scene in Chicago, becoming a vital part of the "Chicago
                Renaissance." In November 1914, he exhibited seven of his sculptures at the Annual Exhibition of
                American
                Oil Paintings and Sculpture in the Art Institute’s galleries. He had two solo exhibitions at the Art
                Institute, in 1916 and 1917, as well as one at the progressive Arts Club in 1919; he also exhibited
                regularly in the juried annuals at the Art Institute. In 1922, he married Helen Walker, the artist
                daughter of Dr. Samuel J. Walker, a prominent member of Chicago society.</p>
